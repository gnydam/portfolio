      <h2>3D printing homes</h2>
      <p>
        The construction industry has traditionally been conservative when it comes to adopting advanced technologies. Innovation may come from the architect, but the builders tend to keep more or less the same process, adapting only to the project at hand.  However, by adopting additive manufacturing, the construction industry can have advantages like better creativity, design flexibility, less material waste, lower carbon footprint, and more robust structures. It’s a fast-growing industry with experts estimating the value of 3D printing construction to reach $56.4 million by 2021. This is a huge market!  3D printing construction has seen some fascinating projects and some massive 3D printers. More and more firms are joining the market, 3D printing more and more homes.

      <h2>Bio-Printing</h2>
      <p>
        "Bioprinting is an additive manufacturing process where biomaterials such as cells and growth factors are combined to create tissue-like structures that imitate natural tissues.  The technology uses a material known as bioink to create these structures in a layer-by-layer manner. The technique is widely applicable to the fields of medicine and bioengineering. Recently, the technology has even made advancements in the production of cartilage tissue for use in reconstruction and regeneration.  In essence, bioprinting works in a similar way to conventional 3D printing. A digital model becomes a physical 3D object layer-by-layer. In this instance, however, a living cell suspension is utilized instead of a thermoplastic or a resin.  For this reason, in order to optimize cell viability and achieve a printing resolution adequate for a correct cell-matrix structure, it’s necessary to maintain sterile printing conditions. This ensures accuracy in complex tissues, requisite cell-to-cell distances, and correct output."- All3dp.com

      <h2>Food Printing</h2>
      <p>
        3D printed food is a way of preparing a meal in an automated additive manner. For example, the 3D printed pizza above has a dough base that is extruded line-by-line by a food 3D printer. A tomato sauce is also applied using the same food 3D Printer. Cheese and oregano were added by hand
